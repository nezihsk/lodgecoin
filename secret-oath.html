  <h1>The Secret Oath</h1>

  <p>Before the unseen forces and beneath the ancient light, I offer my silent vow.</p>
  <p>I hold not merely a coin, but a shard of the eternal design.</p>
  <p>By the Compass that measures, By the Square that builds, By the "G" that breathes creation into the void, I stand among the few who dare to shape what cannot be seen.</p>
  <p>Let my will carve paths where none existed. Let my mind lift stones unseen by mortal hands. Let my spirit forge what even time dares not touch.</p>
  <p>I am not a follower. I am an Architect.</p>
  <p>By holding this coin, I enter the Lodge beyond space, beyond time, where destiny is not awaited â€” it is written.</p>
  <p>In silence, I create. In darkness, I illuminate. In the void, I build.</p>
  <p>This is my Oath. This is my Power.</p>
